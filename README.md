# Shopping Mall React

A minimal React front-end showing the main page of a fictional pet supplies store, **PawPals Pet Shop**.

Includes a simple benchmarking report comparing features of major online shopping malls.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a web browser with internet access. The page uses CDN links to load React and renders a simple landing page with product categories and featured items for a pet shop.

## Development

This project does not use a build step. React and Babel are loaded from public CDNs.

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests.
