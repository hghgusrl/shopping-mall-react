# Shopping Mall React

A minimal React front-end showing the main page of a fictional pet supplies store, **PawPals Pet Shop**.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and build the TypeScript sources:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Open `index.html` in a web browser with internet access. The page uses an import map to load React from a CDN and renders a simple landing page with product categories and featured items for a pet shop.

## Development

TypeScript files in `src/` compile to ES modules in `dist/` via `npm run build`.

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests.
