# Shopping Mall React

A minimal React front-end demonstrating features inspired by five well-known online shopping malls: Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Alibaba, and Rakuten.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a web browser with internet access. The page uses CDN links to load React and renders a list of shopping malls with notable features.

## Development

This project does not use a build step. React and Babel are loaded from public CDNs.

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests.
